# BioGraph: A Space Biology Knowledge Engine

BioGraph is an advanced Space Biology Knowledge Engine designed to provide efficient, reliable, and cost friendly insights in the specialized field of space biology.

Unlike general-purpose AI systems, BioGraph is built exclusively on NASA’s research and data, ensuring that every response is authentic, transparent, and scientifically validated. This approach eliminates misinformation and guarantees research integrity, making BioGraph a trusted companion for scientists, students, and space enthusiasts.

Key Features:

NASA Verified Knowledge Base – All responses are generated solely from NASA’s official data and research.

Concise Scientific Summaries – Answers are short, focused, and easy to understand without unnecessary complexity.

Source Transparency – Each response includes direct references to the original NASA source, ensuring traceability.

Confidence Scoring – Every answer is paired with a confidence score, visually represented in a graph, helping users quickly assess reliability.

Honest Limitations – If no relevant information exists, BioGraph openly communicates this instead of fabricating answers.

Project Goal:

The goal of BioGraph is to create a trustworthy AI assistant that supports discovery and learning in space biology. By bridging artificial intelligence with NASA’s extensive research, BioGraph empowers researchers, educators, and enthusiasts to explore how biological systems interact with the unique challenges of space exploration.
