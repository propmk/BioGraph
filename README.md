# BioGraph: A Space Biology Knowledge Engine

BioGraph is an advanced **Space Biology Knowledge Engine** designed to provide efficient, reliable, and cost-friendly insights in the specialized field of **space biology**.  

Unlike general purpose AI systems, BioGraph is built exclusively on **NASA’s research and data**, ensuring that every response is **authentic, transparent, and scientifically validated**.  
This approach eliminates misinformation and guarantees research integrity, making BioGraph a trusted companion for **scientists, students and space enthusiasts**.


## ✨ Key Features

- NASA Verified Knowledge Base: All responses are generated solely from NASA’s official data and research.  
- Concise Scientific Summaries: Short, focused and easy to understand answers without unnecessary complexity.  
- Source Transparency: Each response includes direct references to original NASA sources for traceability.  
- Confidence Scoring: Every answer is paired with a confidence score, visually represented in a graph.  
- Honest Limitations: If no relevant information exists, BioGraph communicates this clearly instead of fabricating answers.  


## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of **BioGraph** is to create a **trustworthy AI assistant** that supports discovery and learning in space biology.  
By bridging artificial intelligence with NASA’s extensive research, BioGraph empowers researchers, educators and enthusiasts to explore how biological systems interact with the **unique challenges of space exploration**.  


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Streamlit + Altair (for interactive visualizations)  
- **Backend:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, dotenv  
- **AI:** Google Gemini API
